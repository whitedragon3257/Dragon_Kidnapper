# Dragon_Kidnapper

## Architecture

1. **Frequency Control Module**: This module will be responsible for managing the drone's operating frequencies. It must be able to adjust frequencies as needed to ensure effective communication with the drone.

2. **Flight Control Module**: This module will be responsible for issuing flight commands to the drone. This will include commands like take off, land, move left/right, etc.

3. **Telemetry Module**: This module will be responsible for receiving and processing the drone's telemetry data. This may include information such as current altitude,
speed, direction, etc.

4. **User Interface Module**: This module will be responsible for interacting with the user. It must provide a user-friendly interface that allows the user to issue flight commands and view telemetry data.

5. **Security Module**: This module will be responsible for ensuring the safety of the drone.
It must be able to detect dangerous situations (such as low battery or loss of signal) and take appropriate action (such as returning to the takeoff point).
